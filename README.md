## üß† Overview

This project walks through how to build a Kubernetes cluster from scratch on AWS using EC2 instances and manual component setup. No managed services. No shortcuts. Just raw Kubernetes knowledge.

### Project Goals

- Understand Kubernetes internals by building everything manually
- Deploy a working multi-node cluster using AWS EC2
- Use Terraform and bash scripts minimally, focusing on core Kubernetes components
- Document each step clearly and reproducibly
